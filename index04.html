    <H3>Abstract</H3></CENTER>
  <BR>
  <P>My own background for the current interest in tensegrity
    structures, dating back to the sixties, is in Bucky Fuller's
    icosahedral map projection, tesselations of the sphere for
    geodesic domes, and applied math for tensegrity spheres.  I
    produced original results in each of these areas, from which
    my current interests have evolved.</P>
  <P>My mathematics and engineering methods are entirely of a
    naive and amateur nature, as my profession has been entirely
    in computer science, software engineering and algorithms.
    Although I haven't pursued the kinds of characterizations of
    the entire gamut of possible tensegrity forms in the way
    mathematician Robert Connelly (of Cornell U.) has, my work
    has been of a far more "mathematical" nature than most other
    tensegrity researchers.</P>
  <P>I have produced formal mathematical
    characterizations of the tensegrity forms, along with a
    methodology for such work and plans for a continuing and
    expanded research and development program to manufacture a
    wide variety of products based on this class of tensegrities.
    I believe Robert Burkhardt's methods for designing spheres
    using tensegrity trusswork are crucial for most structures.
    Where results of the work discussed here can be applied to
    "linear" structures as special cases of the spherical forms,
    these are of interest as well.</P>
  <P>My interest in tensegrity is focussed on the goals of
    building (albeit by intentional design via thorough and
    careful engineering) useful structures at a variety of
    scales.  I've focussed on a particular limited class of the
    possible tensegrity forms: those that are spherical and of
    maximal symmetry (i.e. based on the tetrahedron, octrahedron
    and icosahedron, with frequencies the product of powers of
    two and three, using Joe Clinton's Class I method of division,
    and comprising exclusively modules each consisting of a "strut"
    and four tendons making up two "bridles" surrounding the strut.</P>
  <P>Images shown in the current summary were originally created
    between 1962 and 1985.  Favorite software tools used in this
    work have included:  MegaCad, Mathematica, Swivel3D, Povray,
    LaTeX, TeX, Metafont and Metapost as well as Perl and the
    Perl Data Language (PDL).</P>

    <H3>Introduction</H3><BR><BR></CENTER>
  <P>The images presented here show results for six-strut (tetrahedral)
    and twelve-strut (octahedral) tensegrity structures for which the
    formal derivations were produced.  The identification of these
    structures with the polyhedra parenthesized above is my own, as a
    result of my observation that these structures can be constructed
    for any point of a continuum that has the (triangulated) polyhedron
    and its dual as special, degenerate, cases at each endpoint.</P>
  <P>The goal for this research is to produce useful products using
    design procedures that support careful optimization of material
    cost and weight invested to produce intended mechanical performance
    in any specific set of anticipated circumstances.  To this end, the
    current stage of development has produced proof-of-concept prototypes
    but not yet the manufacturing production prototypes intended as an
    eventual result.  My hopes are to produce interactive software that
    allows a user to design structures from performance and other types
    of specifications, to see simulated performance animations and see
    numeric calculations of performance, and subsequently produce as
    output complete production specifications and templates adequate
    for manufacturing of the structures as marketable procucts.</P>

    6-strut plot <FONT SIZE=-1>(54 K; c 1976)</FONT><BR>
    <P>This image was a first attempt to show the optimization of
      strut shape to bear the axial-only compression loads for
      tensegrities, and similarly for the axial-only tension loads
      on tendons.  This image was rendered by the MegaCad software.</P>

    <P>This image (and the next three) show the continuum of shapes
      feasible for each example of this class of tensegrities.  In
      them, I represent both struts and tendons with simple lines
      --- and I opaque the "faces" (or openings) of the structures,
      to make the shapes more visually apparent.  I show a short and
      long sequence of shapes from the continuum of possible shapes
      for each of the two forms for which I've shown derived formulas.
      The same treatment will appear for the 30-strut (icosahedral)
      form, once I complete the presentation work.  These images were
      rendered by the MegaCad software.</P>

    derived formulas <FONT SIZE=-1>(33 K; c 1976)</FONT>
    <P>This image shows the formulas I derived for the six-strut
      (tetrahedral) and the twelve strut (octahedral) tensegrity
      forms.  The parameter that determines where, on the continuum of
      possible shapes, each form occurs is (Greek letter) <EM>phi</EM>,
      whose range of variation spans ninety degrees.  The derived distance,
      <EM>d</EM>, from the sphere center to the strut center is
      given in the first formula in each case.  This value entirely
      characterizes the geometry of the shape, but formulas are also
      shown (similarly parameterized) for the two tendon lengths in
      each case.  These formulas were rendered by the LaTeX software.</P>
  <BR><BR><img src="img/p6207062c.jpg"><BR>
    graphs <FONT SIZE=-1>(31 K; c 1976)</FONT><BR>
    <P>These graphs show results for the distance, <EM>d</EM>,
      of the center of the strut from the center of the sphere, as above,
      where the unit of measure is chosen as half the strut length.  The
      horizontal axis is the parameter, <EM>phi</EM>, which represents
      where on the continuum between the triangulated polyhedron and its
      dual a particular structure occurs, and which ranges from zero to
      ninety degrees.
      These graphs were rendered by the Mathematica software.</P>

    <H3>Prototype Lampshade Product</H3><BR><BR></CENTER>
  <BR><BR><img src="img/p6207058pic1b.jpg"><BR>
    lampshade distant unlit <FONT SIZE=-1>(65 K; c 1993)</FONT><BR>
  <P>This lampshade was designed according to specifications indicated
    by the formulas above.  It consists of six identical (wood dowel)
    struts, with smaller-diameter ends (cut by a wood lathe), and six
    identical fabric shapes with metal grommets at strategic locations.
    As a mass-market product, the twelve components can be rolled
    together into a strut-length mailing tube and subsequently
    assembled very simply by the end customer.</P>
  <P>Each strut is inserted with the narrower ends fitting through
    two of the grommets of a single fabric component.  Next each
    strut-fabric combined component is connected with two other
    components so that another grommet fits over each strut-end.  Last,
    three fabric flaps are snapped or buttoned together at the center
    of each of eight faces of the final structure.  One face is left
    open for insertion of the light bulb and cord, and for attachment
    of strings for hanging the shade.  Bill Camp (currently of Berkeley,
    CA) arranged for production of this prototype from my specifications.</P>
  <P>This product can be manufactured in many sizes, out of many possible
    combinations of materials, and in a variety of detailed shapes.
    It can be priced competitively with other hanging lampshade types
    already on the market.  It can be shipped or transported more simply
    than most and assembled easily enough for anyone.</P>

  <P>These sketches show the final design shape for the flaps of the lampshade
    fabric component, where each flap comprises 1/3 of a face of the shade.
    Where each flap overlaps another, a snap or button secures them together.</P>

    12-strut 10' 4"x4" model pic1 <FONT SIZE=-1>(76 K; c 1982)</FONT><BR>
  <P>These six images are slightly different views of a single model of
    twelve feet diameter or so, made to experiment with construction
    techniques.  The struts are ten-foot four-by-fours made of Douglas
    Fir wood, with steel screw-eyes set into the ends.  The tendons are
    quarter-inch steel cable, with loops at either end secured with two
    U-clamps per loop.  A small number of turnbuckles were installed, to
    adjust for errors in guessing differences between "theoretical"
    specifications and "actuals".</P>
  <P>Many practical problems were very instructive in the process, and
    the structure was climbed-upon like as with a playground jungle-gym
    and the structure was rolled around freely on a real grammar-school
    playground, as this is where the assembly and experimentation was
    conducted in Northern Seattle, WA.</P>

    <H3>First Section of the Derivation</H3><BR><BR></CENTER>
  <P>I show here seven pages of the derivation of formal parameterized formulas for the
    several tensegrities addressed.  The first three pages apply to all tensegrities of
    the type I address, because the tensegrity symmetry is not specified, nor is a
    coordinate system chosen, until page four.</P>
  <P>In the diagram, to which the entire derivation refers, there are eight points
    in space, with respect to the typical strut-and-tendon module and its immediate
    neighbor(s), that are labelled with capital letters for reference throughout the
    derivation.  Additional notation is introduced, as needed, throughout.
    These pages were rendered by the LaTeX software.</P>
