tensegrity-work-retrospective
=============================

An historical summary of work accomplished on spherical tensegrity forms

Work on implementations and theory of the structural principles for which
Bucky Fuller coined the term, "tensegrity", has been undertaken on an ad-hoc
basis over the years beginning in the early 1960's.  Documentation of this
work has accumulated and been preserved in a sporadic fashion, so that much
is sketchy and incomplete.  This repository is an attempt to collect, improve
and maintain the records in hopes they will be useful to the broader community.

Detailed records, such as they are, of formal mathematical derivations of the
parameters of a class of tensegrity structures in which I've taken a special
interest are maintained in another repository:

  https://github.com/johnnkirk/tensegrity-derivation

Historical notes, images and original results are documented both there and here
and, hopefully, will become more organized and complete as time passes.
